# GEO-Nav: A geometric dataset of voltage-gated sodium channels

This repository is meant to make the dataset introduced in [1] freely-accessible. For a complete description of both the dataset and the methods that were tested on it, the reader is referred to [1] and to the repository:

### The dataset

The dataset consists of a set of 21 structures and additional 63 synthetically-generated ones. Three additional synthetic models are made available together with ground truth values they were constructed with â€“ to perform initial testing of algorithms and quantitatively estimate the outcome of a method with the geometry of a channel. Each structure is made available in three formats: PDB files, XYZR files, and OFF files. Additionally, we make available the configuration files that were used to generate the triangle meshes (OFF files) via the software NanoShaper.
